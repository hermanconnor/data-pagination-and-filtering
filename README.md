# TECHDEGREE-PROJECT-2
My Second Tech Degree Project.
Pagination is the main goal of this project. Starting with an array of 42 'student' objects, JavaScript is used to dynamically display 9 students per page, and create pagination buttons. 
A search bar was added using JavaScript.
Using JavaScript, the ability to filter through student names in the search bar was added.
